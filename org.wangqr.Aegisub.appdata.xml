  <summary>A free, cross-platform open source tool for creating and modifying subtitles</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Aegisub is a free, cross-platform open source tool for creating and modifying subtitles. Aegisub makes it quick and easy to time subtitles to audio, and features many powerful tools for styling them, including a built-in real-time video preview.</p>
    <p>Aegisub was originally created as a tool to make typesetting, particularly in anime fansubs, a less painful experience. At the time of the start of the project, many other programs that supported the Advanced Substation Alpha format lacked (and in many cases, still lack; development on several competing programs have since been dropped for various reasons completely unrelated to Aegisub) many vital functions, or were too buggy and/or unreliable to be really useful.</p>
    <p>Since then, Aegisub has grown into a fully fledged, highly customizable subtitle editor. It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with timing, typesetting, editing and translating subtitles, as well as a powerful scripting environment called Automation (originally mostly intended for creating karaoke effects, Automation can now be used much else, including creating macros and various other convenient tools).</p>
    <p>Some highlights of Aegisub:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple and intuitive yet powerful interface for editing subtitles</li>
      <li>Support for many formats and character sets</li>
      <li>Powerful video mode</li>
      <li>Visual typesetting tools</li>
      <li>Intuitive and customizable audio timing mode</li>
      <li>Fully scriptable through the Automation module</li>
    </ul>
